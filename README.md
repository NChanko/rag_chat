# Applying Retrieval Augmented Generation to Build a Medical Chatbot

Welcome to our project repository, where we leverage the power of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combined with a vector database and large language models (LLMs) to create a Medical Chatbot. This bot aims to provide summarized answers from authoritative medical sources, including the GP guideline Myanmar, Acute Medicine, and the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Dictionary, making it a valuable tool for medical professionals and students.

## Project Overview

Our Medical Chatbot utilizes a vector database alongside LLMs to retrieve and efficiently summarize relevant medical information. The application is designed to run on Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for interaction. This repository contains the essential components to set up and deploy the chatbot, including the `medical_db.zip` file, which is a compressed vector database required for the bot's operation.
